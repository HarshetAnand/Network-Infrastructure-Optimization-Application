# Network Infrastructure Optimization Application - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- This application optimizes the process of connecting buildings for wired internet access by creating a minimum spanning tree from a list of nodes. Each node represents a building with specific X and Y coordinates. 
- The application utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm, a renowned pathfinding algorithm, to identify the shortest path between these nodes. The goal is to minimize the total length of cables required to connect all buildings, reducing overall project costs and enhancing efficiency. 
- The application's user-friendly interface allows users to input the coordinates of various buildings, and the system outputs the most cost-effective way to connect all buildings.
